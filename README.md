# ShellScript
Scripts that I developed to automate tasks on Linux

## upgradeRPi3
I need an initram image to be able to use and to boot the system in a external HD with LVM partitions. The Operation System Raspbian (for Raspberry Pi 3 B) haven't an initram image native, so when I update the system, the initram image that I created donâ€™t update automatically. This is a problem that happens when the kernel is updated, because the current kernel stays different than the kernel in which the initram image was created. This script solves the problem.
